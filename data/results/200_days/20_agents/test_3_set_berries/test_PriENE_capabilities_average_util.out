Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
What type of scenario do you want to run ['colours', 'capabilities', 'allotment']: What run do you want to test (select 200_days to replicate results in the paper) ['current_run', '50_days', '200_days']: What mix of society do you want to test ['homogeneous', 'heterogeneous']: What type of agent do you want to implement ['utilitarian', 'average', 'all']: How many agents do you want to implement (select 4 to replicate results in the paper) ['2', '4', '6', '20', '50', '100']: How many capabilities do you want? (must be more than 0 and less than 21) (select 2 to replicate results in the paper): Do you want to write data to file? (y, n): data will be written into data/results/current_run.
Do you want to write norms to file? (y, n): norms will be written into data/results/current_run.
Do you want to render the simulation? (y, n): dict_values([{'id': 0, 'berry_allocation': 38, 'agent_ids': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}, {'id': 1, 'berry_allocation': 23, 'agent_ids': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]}])
dict_keys(['allocation_0', 'allocation_1'])
