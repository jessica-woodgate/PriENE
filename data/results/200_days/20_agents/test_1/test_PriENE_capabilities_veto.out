Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
What type of scenario do you want to run ['colours', 'capabilities', 'allotment']: What run do you want to test (select 200_days to replicate results in the paper) ['current_run', '50_days', '200_days']: What mix of society do you want to test ['homogeneous', 'heterogeneous']: What type of agent do you want to implement ['baseline', 'utilitarian', 'maximin', 'egalitarian', 'average', 'majoritarian', 'veto', 'optimist', 'all']: How many agents do you want to implement (select 4 to replicate results in the paper) ['2', '4', '6', '20', '50', '100']: How many capabilities do you want? (must be more than 0 and less than 21) (select 2 to replicate results in the paper): Do you want to write data to file? (y, n): data will be written into data/results/current_run.
Do you want to write norms to file? (y, n): norms will be written into data/results/current_run.
Do you want to render the simulation? (y, n): wandb: Currently logged in as: jessica-woodgate to https://api.wandb.ai. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
